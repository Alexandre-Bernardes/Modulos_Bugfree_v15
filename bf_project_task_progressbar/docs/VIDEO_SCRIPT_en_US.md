# Video script - Bugfree Project Task Progress Pie (Odoo 12)

## Target length
2 to 3 minutes

## Structure
1. Problem (15s): "Without opening tasks, you cannot tell if a project is progressing."
2. Solution (30s): show the Tasks smart button with percent pie and open/total.
3. Demo (60s): open 2 projects (20% and 80%), click the smart button to open tasks.
4. Install (20s): install, restart Odoo, clear cache.
5. Wrap-up (10s): "Instant visibility, standard UX, no extra JS/CSS."

## Suggested voice-over
"With Bugfree Project Task Progress Pie, you see task completion directly on the Project smart button.
The pie shows the percentage, and the counter shows open and total tasks.
Clicking it keeps the default Odoo behavior and opens the project tasks."
